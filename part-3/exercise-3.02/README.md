# Exercise 3.2

For this exercise I followed [this tutorial](https://dev.to/heroku/deploying-to-heroku-from-github-actions-29ej) from Heroku. I made some changes to the code and made sure I understand how it works. I wanted to go with GitHub actions as I'm already using GitHub almost on a daily basis and learning to use another feature of the site would make more sense in this case.  

For the exercise I chose the example frontend project. I had to make slight modifications to the Dockerfile to get it to work on Heroku.
